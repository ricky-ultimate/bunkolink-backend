## **Error Handling**

The application provides meaningful error messages with proper HTTP status codes:
- **404 Not Found**: For non-existent records (e.g., trying to retrieve or delete a book that doesnâ€™t exist).
- **400 Bad Request**: For invalid input or operations (e.g., borrowing a book when no copies are available).
- **409 Conflict**: For duplicate entries (e.g., adding a book or student with an existing unique attribute).

Example error response format:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Book with ID 42 not found.",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-18T12:00:00.000Z",
  "path": "/v1/books/42"
}
```
